# FaBDepth

•	FaBDepth is a Python-based framework which operates on the Pytorch platform.

•	It captures and resizes images at 30 frames per second and saves them in different folders.

•	FaBDepth delivers Foreground-Background separated and Depth estimated images in a unified environment.

•	It makes sure to avoid duplication of frames for applications like Gesture Detection, Object Detection, Traffic Surveillance and Bio-medical Imaging.
